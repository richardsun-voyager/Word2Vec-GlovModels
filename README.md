# Word2Vec-GlovModels
Using word2vec and glovec models to train word embedding vectors, including:
- Skip-gram model
- CBOW model
- Glove model
This dataset is text8 file, and the tool is gensim package. Apart from training the vectors, 
simple intrinsic evaluation such as similarities between words and Tsne plots is employed.
